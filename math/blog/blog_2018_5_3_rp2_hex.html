        <h1>Hex on the real projective plane</h1>
        
  
  
  <P>Some number of years ago while thinking about the games
  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_(game)">Y</A> and
  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">Hex</A>, I
  wondered about what such a game would be like on the real projective
  plane (unaware of
  <A HREF="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31805/projex">Projex</A>).</P>

<div class="figure figure_r">
    <IMG TITLE=""SRC="200_blog_18_5_3_y_board.png">
  </div><P><B>Setup:</B> the game board is a connected graph
  embedded on the surface of a sphere, where the graph has antipodal
  symmetry (so vertices and edges each come in antipodal pairs).  A
  nice example, which is the basis for the Y board, is a
  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_polyhedron#Examples">subdivided icosahedral
  graph</A>.</P>

<P><B>Gameplay:</B> players take turns placing two of their stones on
  antipodal pairs of empty vertices.  The first player to form a path
  connecting a pair of antipodal points is the winner.  Practically
  speaking, the game can take place on a board like the one
  illustrated to the left.  Stones are placed on interior vertices
  like usual, but on the boundary stones are placed in antipodal
  pairs.  With this modified setup, the aim of the game is to make a
  path that connects boundary antipodes.</P>

<P><B>In other words:</B> given a connected graph embedded in
  <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</script> (with at least one essential cycle),
  players take turns placing stones on vertices.  The first player to
  make a path that generates <span class='MathJax_Preview'>H_1(\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2)</span><script type='math/tex'>H_1(\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2)</script> is the
  winner.  This is similar to to Hex, where each player is aiming to
  construct a particular generator of <span class='MathJax_Preview'>H_1((S^1)^2)</span><script type='math/tex'>H_1((S^1)^2)</script>.</P>

<P>A nice feature of the game is that one player winning excludes the
  other player from completing a cycle of their own.  A quick way to
  see this is that a completed cycle is a simple closed curve on the
  sphere, separating the sphere into two disks.  The other player
  would have to construct a path from one disk to the other, which is
  impossible.  This also has to do with the <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}</script>
  intersection form on <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</script>.</P>

<P>I got <A HREF="https://math.berkeley.edu/~morganw/">Morgan</A> to play
  this game at the <A HREF="https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/content/2017-georgia-international-topology-conference">2017 Georgia International Topology
  Conference</A>
  on a subdivided hemi-icosahedron.  One question I had was whether
  one of the players must win, or whether it was possible for there to
  be a draw.  We thought about it for a few minutes and then forgot
  about the problem as we went to the next talk.</P>

<P>Yesterday, I brought the game up again, and Ian Agol pointed out
  that if the graph is a triangulation, the kind of argument for Hex
  should work because one of the components will have to contain a
  Mobius band.  In this post, I&rsquo;m going to flesh out what I thought he
  meant.  For now, assume the game board is a triangulation of
  <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</script>.</P>

<P>Let&rsquo;s say some players have played the game with red and blue
  stones, and for some reason they kept playing until the entire board
  was been filled.  By the exclusion property, it&rsquo;s not the case that
  both the players have completed a cycle, so there is a clear winner
  if there is one at all.  Let&rsquo;s also say we don&rsquo;t care how many of
  each color stone there are, since we&rsquo;re not going to use any sort
  of parity argument.</P>

<P>There are, up to rotation, only four configurations of stones around
  each triangle, depending purely on how many of each color stone
  there are.  In the two cases where there are both colors present,
  there is a well-defined path between midpoints of the triangle&rsquo;s
  edges that separate the two colors.  By taking all such paths, one
  gets a collection of loops in <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</script> that
  intersect the edges of the game graph transversely.  Each region
  between the loops contains stones only of a single color, and when
  crossing a loop that color changes (so the loops define a properly
  <span class='MathJax_Preview'>2</span><script type='math/tex'>2</script>-colored map in <span class='MathJax_Preview'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</span><script type='math/tex'>\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2</script>).</P>

  </CENTER>
<P>At this point, we could use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence with a
  decomposition of the projective plane into two regions whose shared
  boundary is a <span class='MathJax_Preview'>1</span><script type='math/tex'>1</script>-manifold, but I find the following more hands-on
  normal curve argument interesting.</P>

<P>If there is a loop that bounds a disk, then none of the stones
  within that disk can possibly contribute to a winning cycle.
  Furthermore, because of the way the curve is constructed, on just
  the opposite side from the disk there is a non-winning monochromatic
  cycle of stones of the opposite color.  If we replace all the stones
  within the disk with the color of the monochromatic cycle, we do not
  change the winner or whether the game ended in a draw.  (The fact
  that the loop has stones of opposite colors on either side means
  that a regular neighborhood of it is orientable &mdash; and not a
  M&ouml;bius band.)</P>

<P>So, now we may assume that none of the loops bound disks.  But, all
  of the loops have to bound disks!  The loop has stones of opposite
  colors on each side so traces out an orientation-preserving path.
  Maybe I&rsquo;ll fill in this detail in later, but this means the path is
  nullhomotopic, and every nullhomotopic simple closed curve a surface
  bounds a disk.</P>

<P>Therefore, our simplifying assumption implies the game board
  contains stones of only one color.  This obviously contains a
  winning cycle, so that player must have been the winner. No draws!</P>

<P>I have another version of this argument on
  <A HREF="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2669005/when-you-divide-the-real-projective-plane-into-two-subsets-does-it-always-have">math.stackexchange.com</A>.</P>

<H2>Game board designs</H2><P>The design for Projex is a subdivided triangle, where I was
  proposing a subdivided hemi-icosahedron.  With the subdivided
  triangle, it seems like there will be a more intense battle to
  control the center of the board, where the hemi-icosahedron&rsquo;s
  symmetry makes every icosahedral face equally valuable, so early
  mistakes might not cost the game.  I actually don&rsquo;t know how much
  this affects gameplay, but maybe I will simulate it someday.</P>
