        <p>Drag the circular handles on the two colored vectors in the
        right vector space to specify a basis.</p>

        <p>The left vector space is the space of coordinates for the
        vector space to the right.</p>

        <p>Drag the point in the left vector space to specify a
        coordinate <em>c</em>: the corresponding vector <em>B</em>(<em>c</em>)
        appears in the right vector space.</p>

        <p>Drag the point in the right vector space to specify a
        vector <em>v</em>: the corresponding
        coordinate <em>B</em><sup>-1</sup>(<em>v</em>) appears in the left vector
        space.</p>

        <p>If the black point is to escape the square region on either
          side, its position is "clamped."  This is to make sure you
          can always see the point in both vector spaces at all times.
          The "preimage" of the boundary of the right vector space is
          represented as a parallelogram in the left, and its only
          purpose is to show the limits to the point's location.</p>

        <p>If the vectors are linearly dependent (that is, if the
          basis matrix has a zero determinant), then dragging the
          black point is temporarily disabled.</p>

        <p>The standard basis for the right vector space is shown as a
        light blue grid.</p>

        <h2>Guided tour</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>With the (default) standard basis, move the point around.  What is the relationship between the point and its coordinate?</li>
          <li>Move the green vector to (1,1) and the red vector to
          (-1,1).  Move the point to (2,1) in the right vector space:
          check that its coordinates are (1.5,-0.5).  Move the point
          to coordinate (1,1) in the left vector space: check that the
          corresponding vector is (0,2).</li>
          <li>Create a basis with determinant 1 and with determinant
          -1.  What is the sign of the determinant measuring?  Look at
          the spatial relationship between the green and red vectors
          in each case.
          <li>Let's pretend that the horizontal axis in the right side
          represents the constant term of a polynomial, and the
          vertical axis the linear term, so (<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)
          is <em>a</em> + <em>bx</em>.  Move the green vector to 1
          - <em>x</em> and the red vector to 1 + <em>x</em>.  What is
          the coordinate of 2<em>x</em>?  (Check that it is
          (-1,1).)</li>
